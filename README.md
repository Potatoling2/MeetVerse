# MeetVerse

This is a program designed to create an all in one program for password protection.
It will provide an additional layer of seeded, random encryption to passwords
On top of all that, it will conveniently allow users to sign into websites. (In theory)
Note: Product cannot actually sign you into websites. This is just a proof of concept that could be further implemented into websites.
Thank you for viewing!
